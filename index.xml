If one of the processes writes to one of these shared pages, the data is copied to a new physical page and the virtual-to-physical-memory mappings are updated according to the changes. This techniqie is used (and abused) in many different scenarios.</description></item><item><title>gcc Silent Trampoline Execstack Abuse</title><link>https://6sixty6.github.io/posts/2022-02-19-gcc-silent-trampoline-execstack-abuse/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Feb 2022 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://6sixty6.github.io/posts/2022-02-19-gcc-silent-trampoline-execstack-abuse/</guid><description>author:[xoreaxeax] Danger by design of GNU&amp;rsquo;s GCC nested functions raises from use of trampolines - small pieces of code used to implement pointers to nested functions.
These trampolines are created on stack, meaning the stack needs to be marked as executable for nested functions to be executed - the nested function pointer is after all the address of the trampoline itself.
Executable stack is heavily frowned upon on modern systems. In this case however, the bigger problem arises from the stack being set to RWE (Read/Write/Execute) silently, without any warning message during compilation and linking.</description></item><item><title>About Us</title><link>https://6sixty6.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2016 17:51:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://6sixty6.github.io/about/</guid><description>WHO ARE WE ?
